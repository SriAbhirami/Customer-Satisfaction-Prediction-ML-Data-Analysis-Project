# Customer Satisfaction Prediction

This project aims to predict customer satisfaction using a dataset of support tickets from customers of tech products. It covers the full machine learning workflow â€” from data cleaning and analysis to model building and evaluation.

---

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- Customer Age and Gender  
- Product Purchased and Date of Purchase  
- Ticket Type, Priority, Status, and Channel  
- Response Times  
- Customer Satisfaction Rating (target variable)

---

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed unnecessary columns  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted and extracted date features  
   - Encoded categorical data

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized satisfaction ratings, age, gender, ticket types, and priorities  
   - Analyzed relationships between variables

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created new features like resolution time and purchase month  
   - Prepared data for model training

4. **Model Building**  
   - Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict satisfaction ratings  
   - Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted distributions, pie charts, bar plots, and feature importance

## Conclusion

This project showed that customer satisfaction can be predicted effectively using machine learning techniques. Features like ticket type, resolution time, and product purchased had a strong influence on customer satisfaction.

---

## Future Scope

- Try different ML models like XGBoost  
- Perform sentiment analysis on ticket descriptions  
- Build a web app to predict satisfaction in real-time  
- Automate feedback analysis for customer service teams
